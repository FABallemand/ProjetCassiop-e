# üñê Real Time Hand Gesture Recognition Demonstration

## üëâ Description
This folder contains three programs that demonstrate the use of real time automatic gesture recognition by controlling a computer using hand signs.
- **prediction.py** is a simple script that simply displays the prediction of the sign
- **volume_control.py** allows you to control the sound level of a Linux computer
- **brightness_control.py** provides another way of controlling the screen brightness of a Windows computer
**train_model.py** or **train_model.ipynb** can be used to train the model.
